10.1 ‘ls’: List directory contents
==================================

The ‘ls’ program lists information about files 
(of any type, including directories)

   For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by
default ‘ls’ lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and
omitting files with names beginning with ‘.’. 
   By default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the
locale settings in effect

   ‘ls’ is such a fundamental program, it has accumulated many
options over the years.  They are described in the subsections below;

   Exit status:

     0 success
     1 minor problems  (e.g., failure to access a file or directory not
       specified as a command line argument.  This happens when listing a
       directory in which entries are actively being removed or renamed.)
     2 serious trouble (e.g., memory exhausted, invalid option, failure
       to access a file or directory specified as a command line argument
       or a directory loop)
